Recently [I spoke about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRFxBBKn4hI) [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in a lightning talk at [ACM@UC](https://acmatuc.org). Netlify is a PaaS (platform as a service) that makes life easier for developers to create and maintain modern web applications. It's perfect for serverless back-ends (backed by AWS Lambda) and static front-ends with dynamic functionality (authentication, forms, etc.).

[Netlify dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) is a great command line tool and development environment. It simplifies your local development workflow and aids in deploying to the Netlify platform.

_Note: I'm not sponsored by Netlify, I just like their platform!_
