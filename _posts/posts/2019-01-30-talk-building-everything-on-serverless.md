Recently [I talked about serverless and serverless computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRFd-PHyu7g&t=324) at [ACM@UC](https://acmatuc.org). Serverless is a form of cloud computing that's changing the way software is delivered.

The talk is an introduction to serverless. It's designed for college students (as it was given at the University of Cincinnati), but all of the information presented is a great resource for anyone interested in getting started with serverless. Covered is:

1. Why serverless (what's the motivation for serverless)?
2. Serverless patterns - good use cases and bad use cases
3. A demo of writing, testing, and deploying your first serverless function to the cloud (on AWS Lambda)
