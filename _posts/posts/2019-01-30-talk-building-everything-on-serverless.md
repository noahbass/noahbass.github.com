This past week, I talked about serverless and serverless compute at [ACM@UC](https://acmatuc.org). Serverless is a form of cloud computing that is changing the way software is delivered.

There are several misconceptions about serverless and it's use cases. The talk introduces key characteristics of serverless and serverless apps, how serverless compute works, then dives into a live demonstration.

The talk is an introduction to the world of serverless and covers:

1. Why serverless (what's the motivation for serverless)?
2. Serverless patterns, good use cases, and bad use cases
3. Writing, testing, and deploying your first serverless function (on AWS Lambda)
