Last month I was [elected ACM@UC president](https://twitter.com/ACMatUCorg/status/984793329287118849) for the 2018-19 academic year. Previously, I served as secretary for two years. I'm thrilled to be able to lead the organization and to continue to advocate for the computing community at the University of Cincinnati. [ACM@UC](https://acmatuc.org/) powers the computer science community on campus and is open to all students interested in computing, regardless of major.

My goals as ACM@UC president are fairly simple: to direct the organization in fulfilling its mission to build a stronger computing community on our campus and in the greater area, be an advocate for all students in our community, surround ourselves with awesome, talented people, and help members in completing their missions.

Today, ACM@UC is a strong organization with a solid membership base. We’re responsible for some awesome annual events such as [RevolutionUC](http://revolutionuc.com/), [Local Hack Day](http://localhackday.acmatuc.org/), and [ICPC](http://gauss.ececs.uc.edu/Contests/). With this in mind, I see opportunities for our club to experiment, learn, and grow. We can make ACM@UC the best student organization on campus.

I can’t wait to get to work with the new exec board!
